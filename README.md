# thinker — a knowledge cache for coding agents

Coding agents re-orient in a repo every session: grep, read, trace imports,
figure out how X flows from A to B. `thinker` caches that understanding as
short notes keyed to the code they describe, and serves the relevant ones
into each request. When the code under a note changes, the note is flagged
stale and re-verified.

**With Claude Fable on real tasks, the cache cut wall time, lowered token usage and cost, and raised the correctness score.**

```
wall time            without thinker  ████████████████████  2.7 min
                     with thinker     █████████████████░░░  2.3 min 14% faster

input tokens         without thinker  ████████████████████  1.25M
                     with thinker     ████████████████░░░░  1.02M   18% less tokens

cost per task        without thinker  ████████████████████  $2.72
                     with thinker     ██████████████████░░  $2.45   10% cheaper

correctness score    without thinker  ████████████████░░░░  80%
                     with thinker     ██████████████████░░  89%     +10% improved
```

[See the benchmark](#benchmarks).

Works with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI and Cursor. Research prototype.

## Install and start

Open [zerotime.dev](https://zerotime.dev), enter your access code, and run the
private install command shown there from inside your repository. The same code
unlocks the docs.

Then work with your agent as usual. Notes are added to each request
automatically.

To check the value on your own repository after setup, run the paired onboarding benchmark on a recent PR change or specific workflow question:

```bash
# Benchmark on a recent PR change (compares efficiency & target file location)
thinker benchmark pr [number]

# Or benchmark a specific question without and with Thinker context
thinker benchmark run "explain how <a real workflow> works"

# Show the latest comparison again
thinker benchmark report
```

It makes two read-only agent calls, without and with relevant thinker notes,
and compares time, turns and tokens. It saves both answers under
`.thinker/benchmarks/` so you can review quality; it does not pretend that
speed alone is a correctness score. If the first question is not covered well
enough by the cache, no agent calls are made and Thinker prints alternative
benchmark commands based on topics it can cover. Copy one of those suggestions
and try again.

Notes:

- **Requirements.** git, curl, tar, Node 20+, and at least one of the agents above, logged in.
- **What it does.** Installs the tool under `~/.thinker`, builds a cache of
  notes from the repository's git history, merged pull requests and source
  areas, and wires it into the agents found on the machine.
- **Cost.** Building costs roughly $9 of agent usage with the defaults. The
  estimate is printed before anything runs.
- **Already have a cache?** Use `--cache <file|url>` instead of `--build`.
  See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) for all options.

## Cache cost and savings

Run `thinker usage --here` to compare this repository's cache spending with its
estimated savings, or `thinker usage` for every repository on the machine.
`--days 7` limits the period; `--json` includes spending by operation, provider/model,
and repository.

The report separates cache initialization (exploration, PR mining, seed distillation
and phrasings), ongoing session distillation, and maintenance. It records reported
input/output tokens, provider prompt-cache reads/writes, dollar cost when available,
and missing usage. Model calls that produce no notes, dry-run distillations, and
failed attempts count too. Tokens reported before an invalid model answer are retained;
failures without counters remain unknown. No model pricing is guessed, and CLI dollar
figures are provider-reported usage costs, not necessarily an extra subscription charge.

The token balance subtracts both injected notes and reported build/maintenance tokens
from estimated file-reading tokens avoided. Savings still require a session assessment
that the note was used. This is a token comparison, not measured dollar ROI: models and
cached inputs have different prices. Older logs omitted tokens and setup exploration,
so historical totals cannot establish full payback. A limited date range also excludes
setup spending outside that period.

To evaluate a less expensive distillation approach, compare the same transcripts with
`thinker distill <transcript> --dry --model <model>`, then inspect usage and note quality.
`--dry` still calls a model and records its usage, but does not save notes. The existing
`distillModel` setting in `.thinker/config.json` chooses the default distiller for session
learning and PR mining; an explicit `--model` or `THINKER_LLM_MODEL` takes precedence.
The report's no-new-note/no-merge counts help identify low-yield runs, though those runs
may still assess existing notes. Keep quality and downstream task correctness in the
comparison, not just note count.

## Benchmarks

Real tasks from merged pull requests, each run with and without the cache. Evaluated on Claude Fable (20 pairs via Claude Code), Gemini 3.8 Flash (14 pairs via Antigravity CLI), and OpenAI GPT-6 Astra (21 pairs via Codex CLI), all independently graded on calibrated acceptance criteria.

### Key Takeaways for Users

- **⏱️ Timing:** Eliminates blind repo exploration and prevents rabbit holes, cutting wall time by **7% to 14%** (saving up to **100+ seconds** on complex Grafana tasks).
- **🪙 Token Usage & Cost:** Pre-seeded architecture notes reduce input tokens and context re-reads by **18% to 21%**, directly lowering cost per task by **10% to 16%**.
- **🔍 Tool Efficiency:** Reduces tool calls across every evaluated agent harness — Claude Code (**-17%**), Codex CLI (**-18%**, lower in 15 of 21 tasks), and Antigravity CLI (**-22%**).
- **🎯 Correctness:** On frontier models (Claude Fable), thinker boosts overall correctness by **+10%** and lifts complete task passes from **45% to 60%** (+3 tasks). Fast and frontier models (Gemini Flash, GPT-6 Astra) maintain strict correctness parity (within single-run noise).

## Updates and testing branches

Thinker auto-updates daily in the background. To check or update manually at any time:

```bash
thinker update
```

S3/archive installs check `version.json` beside their saved private download URL
and verify the release checksum without GitHub credentials. Git checkouts update from their
Git remote. Daily updates run on invocation and, when installed, through the OS
scheduler; they are not an immediate push to every client.

Clients installed before 0.1.1 may be unable to update without GitHub access.
Refresh the updater once: sign in at [zerotime.dev](https://zerotime.dev), copy
the private install command, and replace its final `| bash` with
`| bash -s -- --update`. This preserves the existing home and telemetry settings
and saves the private download URL for unattended updates.

To test a specific branch version:

```bash
# Switch to a branch version (or tag)
thinker switch <branch-name>
# or: thinker update <branch-name>

# Check current branch
thinker branch

# Switch back to main
thinker switch main
```

See `thinker update --status` for current install and schedule details, or `thinker update --schedule` / `thinker update --unschedule` to manage OS-level background updates.

## Metrics and telemetry

Thinker records pseudonymous installation and daily effectiveness metrics (cache hit rate, notes count, estimated token savings) to track cache performance. Reports include a persistent installation ID and a Thinker-specific device hash, so separate installations on the same OS instance can be grouped. The hash is derived locally from the OS machine identifier using HMAC-SHA256; the raw identifier is never sent. No prompt text, note bodies, code snippets, file paths, or repository URLs are collected or transmitted.

The device hash is independent of `THINKER_HOME`. It can change after OS reinstallation, and cloned VMs or containers may share an identifier. If the OS identifier is unavailable, the device remains unknown. Test runs allow telemetry only to local test servers; they do not send it to production.

```bash
thinker telemetry           # inspect current daily metrics summary and transmission status
thinker telemetry --send    # send metrics manually
```

To opt out at any time, set `THINKER_TELEMETRY=off` in your environment or set `"telemetry": false` in `.thinker/config.json`.
